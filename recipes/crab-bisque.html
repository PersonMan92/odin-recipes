    <img src="crab-bisque.jpg" alt="Medium crab bisque" width="300">

    <p>A spicy, creamy bisque that combines the flavors of a tomato-carrot bisque with rich lump crab and some spicy seasoning.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, chopped</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 – 14.5 ounce cans Organic Fire-roasted diced tomatoes*</li>
        <li>2 cups shrimp/seafood stock* + 1 cup water or 2 cups chicken stock + 1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream or half & half for a lighter soup</li>
        <li>8-10 ounces lump crab meat</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh herb e.g., parsley, chives, dill</li>
        <li>Finishing oil*</li>
        <li>¼ tsp. dill seed</li>
        <li>½ tsp. Sweet paprika*</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Chimayo Red Chile Powder* or to taste</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp. basil purée or pesto*</li>
        <li>1 tsp. prepared horseradish* or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium low heat. When hot, add the onions, carrots, shallot, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally until onion and shallots are starting to brown about 5 - 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the dill seed, paprika and chile powder. Sitr into vegetables for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, basil purée and horseradish.</li>
        <li>Use a little water or stock to rinse out the tomato cans. Transfer liquid to the soup pot.</li>
        <li>Add the stock and water.</li>
        <li>Stir and heat over medium until soup comes to a boil. Reduce heat for a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Using an immersion blender, blend the soup into a smooth texture.</li>   
        <li>Return to a medium low heat and simmer another 10 minutes. If the soup is not smooth enough, blend again. You may need to add a little more water if the soup if too thick to your liking. I usually end up adding about 1/2 cup more. Just be careful not to get it too thin.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cream.</li>
        <li>If you plan on serving immediately, reheat the soup to a low simmer, simmer for 5 minutes and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>If you plan to serve later or the next day, let the soup cool and refrigerate. When ready to serve, heat soup over medium-low heat to a low simmer and simmer for 5 minutes until heated through.</li>
        <li>To serve, scoop bisque into serving bowls, place about 1/4 cup of lump crab into the middle of the bowl, drizzle with some finishing oil and top with your choice of chopped fresh herb. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
